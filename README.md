# ReVis
An alternate redis GUI client.

ReVis lets you easily connect to and browse the contents of any of your Redis instances in an intuitive GUI. Specify your connection and immediately access that connection's keys. Search through keys by entering a regex just like in redis-cli.

This project contains the ReVis frontend. The backend, which starts and stops along with the frontend, may be found [here](https://github.com/bencase/revis-service).
